# Implementing a support vector machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset.
---
- The folder, train, consists of labeled images of cats and dogs. These images are the data that is used to train the model.
- The folder, test, contains images of cats and dogs. However, these images aren't labeled. The model is then used to classify these images to either cat or dog.
- the .ipynb file, TASK 3, shows the steps to which these images were classified.
- the .csv file, results, shows the laeling of the images in the test folder.
